"""
SCx61 Week 2 — Lab Step 5 (STUDENT STARTER): row-strip decomposition,
NO halo exchange — fill in the TODOs.

Master-worker pattern: rank 0 splits the image into `size` contiguous
row strips, sends each worker its own strip, each rank filters ONLY
its own strip in isolation, and rank 0 gathers the results back into a
full image.

THIS VERSION HAS NO HALO EXCHANGE ON PURPOSE (that's Step 6). Predict
before you run: every rank's 3x3 box blur edge-replicates at the TOP
and BOTTOM of its own strip — for the TRUE top/bottom of the image
that's correct, but for an INTERNAL strip boundary it's wrong, because
the real neighboring pixels live in a different rank's strip.

PREDICT: how many rows of the final image do you expect to differ from
filter_ref.py's serial output, and WHERE? Write your prediction down
before running — then check it with compare.py.
